A RESTful API built with Express.js, Prisma, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL for managing blog-style posts. The project is structured for clarity, scalability, and easy integration with DevOps workflows.

---

## Features

- Full CRUD operations for posts
- Type-safe ORM using Prisma
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Express.js with TypeScript for server logic
- Environment-based configuration
- Ready for containerization and cloud deployment

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- PostgreSQL installed and running locally or on a cloud instance
- npm or yarn

---

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
````

---

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file at the root:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:your_encoded_password@localhost:5432/your_database"
```

If your password contains special characters like `@`, encode them (e.g., `@` becomes `%40`).

---

### Prisma Setup

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
# or if not using migrations
npx prisma db push
```

---

### Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the server runs at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Sample Payloads

### Create Post (POST /api/posts)

```json
{
  "title": "Getting started with Prisma",
  "content": "Prisma is a modern ORM for Node.js and TypeScript"
}
```

### Update Post (PUT /api/posts/1)

```json
{
  "title": "Updated title",
  "content": "Updated content"
}
```

## Postman Collection

The project includes a Postman collection file (`postman_collection.json`) for testing API routes.
To use it:

1. Open Postman
2. Click `Import`
3. Select the `postman_collection.json` file

---

## Technology Stack

* Express.js with TypeScript
* PostgreSQL
* Prisma ORM
* Nodemon for development
* Postman for manual testing

---

## Future Improvements

* Add JWT-based user authentication
* Role-based access control (Admin, Editor)
* Dockerize the backend
* Deploy to cloud (Render, Azure, Railway, etc.)
* Add CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
* Add logging and error monitoring
